# Maths probability project

I have been tasked with a maths assignment in which I am to design a series of probability-based games. The probably of winning every game and claiming the final prize money should be no more than 1/200.

The task sheet suggests you to test your games on friends, however as I am lacking in 200+ friends, I decided it would be more fun to simulate it instead. Even if this ends up being invalid for the maths assignement, at least I had fun programming this!

This is the perfect way to convince myself to study for something after all.
